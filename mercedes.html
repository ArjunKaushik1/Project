    <h2>Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One</h2>
    <p>
      Mercedes-Benz, a brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved in
      Formula One as both team owner and engine manufacturer for various periods
      since 1954. The Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team, which is based in Brackley,
      England,[1] and possesses a German licence,[2] is as of 2022 majority
      owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group with Toto Wolff having a significant
      shareholding. Mercedes-branded teams are often referred to by the
      nickname, the "Silver Arrows". An announcement was made in December
      2020[3] that Ineos planned to take a one third equal ownership stake
      alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and Wolff; this came into effect on 25
      January 2022.[4] Before the Second World War, Mercedes-Benz competed in
      the European Championship, winning three titles. The marque debuted in
      Formula One in 1954. After winning their first race at the 1954 French
      Grand Prix, driver Juan Manuel Fangio won another three Grands Prix to win
      the 1954 Drivers' Championship and repeated this success in 1955. Despite
      winning two Drivers' Championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor
      racing after 1955 in response to the 1955 Le Mans disaster. Mercedes
      returned to Formula One in 1994 as an engine manufacturer in association
      with Ilmor, a British independent high-performance autosport engineering
      company, which developed their engines. The company won one constructors'
      title and three drivers' titles in a works partnership with McLaren which
      lasted until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as Mercedes AMG High
      Performance Powertrains. In 2010, the company bought the Brawn GP team,
      rebranding it as Mercedes. Since a major rule shake-up in 2014, which
      required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric engines, Mercedes
      has become one of the most successful teams in Formula One history,
      winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from 2014 to 2020 and eight
      consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. It has set records for
      most wins in a season (19 in 2016), and for most consecutive constructors'
      titles. The manufacturer has also collected more than 200 wins as an
      engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten
      Constructors' and thirteen Drivers' Championships have been won with
      Mercedes-Benz engines.
