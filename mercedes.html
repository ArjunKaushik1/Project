            Mercedes-Benz, a brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved
            in Formula One as both team owner and engine manufacturer for
            various periods since 1954. The Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team, which
            is based in Brackley, England,[1] and possesses a German licence,[2]
            is as of 2022 majority owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group with Toto
            Wolff having a significant shareholding. Mercedes-branded teams are
            often referred to by the nickname, the "Silver Arrows". An
            announcement was made in December 2020[3] that Ineos planned to take
            a one third equal ownership stake alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group
            and Wolff; this came into effect on 25 January 2022.[4] Before the
            Second World War, Mercedes-Benz competed in the European
            Championship, winning three titles. The marque debuted in Formula
            One in 1954. After winning their first race at the 1954 French Grand
            Prix, driver Juan Manuel Fangio won another three Grands Prix to win
            the 1954 Drivers' Championship and repeated this success in 1955.
            Despite winning two Drivers' Championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew
            from motor racing after 1955 in response to the 1955 Le Mans
            disaster. Mercedes returned to Formula One in 1994 as an engine
            manufacturer in association with Ilmor, a British independent
            high-performance autosport engineering company, which developed
            their engines. The company won one constructors' title and three
            drivers' titles in a works partnership with McLaren which lasted
            until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as Mercedes AMG High
            Performance Powertrains. In 2010, the company bought the Brawn GP
            team, rebranding it as Mercedes. Since a major rule shake-up in
            2014, which required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric
            engines, Mercedes has become one of the most successful teams in
            Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from
            2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to
            2021. It has set records for most wins in a season (19 in 2016), and
            for most consecutive constructors' titles. The manufacturer has also
            collected more than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked
            second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and thirteen
            Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.

            ‘Still I Rise’ – these are the words emblazoned across the back of
            Lewis Hamilton’s helmet and tattooed across his shoulders, and ever
            since annihilating expectations with one of the greatest rookie
            performances in F1 history in 2007, that’s literally all he’s done:
            risen to the top of the all-time pole positions list ahead of his
            hero Ayrton Senna, surged into first place in the wins column
            surpassing the inimitable Michael Schumacher, and then matched the
            legendary German’s seven world titles. Is he the G.O.A.T? Few would
            deny that he’s in the conversation – and what’s more he’s got there
            his way, twinning his relentless speed with a refusal to conform to
            stereotypes for how a racing driver should think, dress or behave.
            Respect is hard earned in F1, but Hamilton – now Sir Lewis Hamilton
            to be precise – has it from every one of his peers. Why? Because
            they know that whatever the track, whatever the conditions, whatever
            the situation, when his visor goes down and the lights go out, it’s
            Hammertime.

          <td class="bio">
            He’s the driver with the motto: “If in doubt, go flat out”. George
            Russell has lived by it in his F1 career to date, out-qualifying
            seasoned team mate Robert Kubica at all 21 Grands Prix in his rookie
            season, putting Williams back on the podium in 2021, and landing a
            Mercedes race seat alongside Lewis Hamilton for 2022. That brilliant
            baseline speed served Russell well as he totted up titles on his way
            to Formula 1. The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and
            delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure. Spotting
            his potential, world champions Mercedes swooped to sign him to their
            junior programme in 2017, when Russell already had a DTM deal on the
            table. He banked more experience with practice sessions with Force
            India and tests for the Silver Arrows, before landing his
            Mercedes-powered Williams race drive. A refusal to cede ground to
            his rivals - and commitment to a tricky pass – underpins Russell’s
            winning mentality. And it’s what got him the call-up to replace
            Lewis Hamilton for a one-off Mercedes appearance for Sakhir 2020
            when the reigning champ was struck down by Covid-19. That star turn
            saw Russell miss out on pole by just 0.026s and then outrace
            Mercedes stalwart Valtteri Bottas. Only a bungled pit stop and a
            heart-breaking late puncture prevented a near-certain maiden win for
            the up-and-coming super-sub. He kept his head down at Williams in
            2021, scoring his first points and podium, all the while keeping his
            eye on the bigger prize. Having proved himself a hard worker and a
            tenacious talent, that prize arrived in the form of a chance to take
            on compatriot and seven-time champion Hamilton in identical
            machinery. A huge challenge, but as always, ‘Russell the Rocket’
            will be going flat out.
