          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of
            international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing
            cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile
            (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula
            One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of
            racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word
            formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all
            participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a
            series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on
            both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads. A points system
            is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships:
            one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a
            valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by
            the FIA. The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the
            highest grade-rating issued by the FIA. Formula One cars are the
            fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to
            very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large
            amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars underwent major changes
            in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres,
            resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds
            of around 350 km/h (215 mph). As of 2021, the hybrid engines are
            limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm; the cars are
            dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres.
            Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other
            electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were
            briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned
            since 2004 and 2008 respectively. With the average annual cost of
            running a team – designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay,
            transport – being approximately US$247 million, its financial and
            political battles are widely reported. On 23 January 2017, Liberty
            Media completed the acquisition of the Formula One Group, from
            private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for $8 billion.

          <h3>Hisotry of Formula 1</h3>
          <p>
            The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of
            Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists
            of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One
            was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first
            non-championship races taking place that year. The first Formula 1
            race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing
            organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before
            World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the
            conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised
            until 1947. The first world championship race took place at
            Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. Giuseppe Farina, in his
            Alfa Romeo, won the first World Championship for Drivers in 1950,
            narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio
            won the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of
            five World Championship titles stood for 45 years until Michael
            Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was
            interrupted (after an injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of
            Ferrari. A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although
            the UK's Stirling Moss was able to compete regularly, he was never
            able to win the world championship. In a seven-year span between
            1955 and 1961, Moss finished as championship runner-up four times
            and in third place the other three times. Fangio, however, achieved
            the record of winning 24 of the 52 races he entered - a record that
            holds to this day. National championships existed in South Africa
            and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One
            events were held by promoters for many years. However, due to the
            increasing cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.
