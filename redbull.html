            Red Bull Racing, also simply known as Red Bull or RBR and competing
            as Oracle Red Bull Racing, is a Formula One racing team, racing a
            Honda-built Red Bull powered car under an Austrian licence and based
            in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Formula One teams owned by
            beverage company Red Bull GmbH, the other being Scuderia AlphaTauri
            (previously Scuderia Toro Rosso). The Red Bull Racing team has been
            managed by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005. Red Bull
            had Cosworth engines in 2005 and Ferrari engines in 2006. The team
            used engines supplied by Renault between 2007 and 2018 (from 2016 to
            2018, the Renault engine was re-badged "TAG Heuer" following the
            breakdown in the relationship between Red Bull and Renault in 2015).
            During this partnership, they won four successive Drivers' and
            Constructors' Championship titles from 2010 to 2013, becoming the
            first Austrian team to win the title. The team began using Honda
            engines in 2019. The works Honda partnership culminated in 2021
            following Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's World Drivers'
            Championship victory. Honda will continue to supply complete engines
            from Japan to Red Bull and AlphaTauri until the end of 2025.

            He’s Max by name, and max by nature. Arriving as Formula 1’s
            youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his
            car, his rivals and the sport’s record books to the limit. The
            baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro Rosso –
            and then the Red Bull – by the horns with his instinctive racing
            style. F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race
            winner – at the age of 18 years and 228 days – with an opportunistic
            but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true
            wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back
            of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the
            plaudits coming. Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard
            defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and
            paymasters. But the mistakes that initially marred his potential
            have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make
            him a blockbuster talent have remained – and the victories have kept
            on coming, culminating in his first F1 drivers’ title following that
            already legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021.
            The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick karting
            Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out
            of Dad’s house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his
            family, and though he’s not afraid to speak his mind, he can still
            be surprisingly shy. Having become the Netherlands' first world
            champion aged just 24, the expectations for the next generation’s
            leading light are sky high – but with Verstappen there’s a feeling
            that the sky’s the limit.

            He’s the fighter with a gentle touch from the land of the Lucha
            Libre. Perez’s reputation in F1 has been built on opposite
            approaches to Grand Prix racing. On the one hand, he is a punchy
            combatant who wrestles his way through the pack and into the points.
            Never afraid to add a bit of spice to his on-track encounters, even
            his team mates don’t always escape the Mexican’s heat. Then on the
            other hand, Perez is a smooth operator, a master at managing tyres
            to eke out extra performance and give him the upper hand on
            strategy. A firm favourite on the grid after his time with Sauber,
            McLaren, Force India and Racing Point, Perez has matured into an
            analytical racer and team player. A proud countryman, the
            Guadalajara gunslinger has amassed more points than any other
            Mexican in the history of F1. In Sakhir 2020 he also matched hero
            and compatriot Pedro Rodriguez by taking the chequered flag in first
            – a performance that landed him a seat with title contenders Red
            Bull. There he provided strong support to Max Verstappen’s 2021
            championship-winning campaign, also adding another victory to his
            own tally. More wins may not be assured, especially with Verstappen
            as team mate, but Perez working hard and racing with his heart are.
