        <ul>
            <li>What the Website is about?</li>
            <p>
                My website is going to be about the Formula 1 racer, Lewis Hamilton. Lewis is a British native who was not born with much, however, 
                the hard work done by him and his father led him to go on and become one of - if not the best - racing driver in the world.
                Lewis is not only a racing driver but also a strong advocate of racism. His work with helping his community and striving to 
                achieve greatness on the track simultaneously makes him a great icon to learn from. As a result I will be making this website to 
                provide more information about him and show his accomplishments.
            </p>

                achievements of Lewis Hamilton so people can learn more about him like who he is, what he does, and in recent years why has he become 
                a global superstar.
            </p>
