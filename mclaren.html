            McLaren Racing Limited is a British motor racing team based at the
            McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, Surrey, England. McLaren is
            best known as a Formula One constructor, the second oldest active
            team, and the second most successful Formula One team after Ferrari,
            having won 183 races, 12 Drivers' Championships and 8 Constructors'
            Championships. McLaren also has a history of competing in American
            open wheel racing, as both an entrant and a chassis constructor, and
            has won the Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am) sports car
            racing championship. The team is a subsidiary of the McLaren Group,
            which owns a majority of the team. Founded in 1963 by New Zealander
            Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian
            Grand Prix, but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which
            they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed,
            with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue in 1972
            and Johnny Rutherford in 1974 and 1976. After Bruce McLaren died in
            a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer took over and led the team
            to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in 1974, with
            Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt winning the Drivers' Championship
            in 1974 and 1976 respectively. 1974 also marked the start of a
            long-standing sponsorship by the Marlboro cigarette brand. In 1981,
            McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing; Dennis took
            over as team principal, and shortly afterwards organised a buyout of
            the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team.
            This began the team's most successful era; with Porsche and Honda
            engines, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, and Ayrton Senna won seven
            Drivers' Championships between them and the team took six
            Constructors' Championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was
            particularly dominant—together they won all but one race in 1988—but
            later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow
            English team Williams offered the most consistent challenge during
            this period, the two winning every constructors' title between 1984
            and 1994. By the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One,
            Senna had moved to Williams, and the team went three seasons without
            a win. With Mercedes-Benz engines, West sponsorship, and former
            Williams designer Adrian Newey, further championships came in 1998
            and 1999 with driver Mika Häkkinen, and during the 2000s the team
            were consistent front-runners, with driver Lewis Hamilton taking
            their latest title in 2008. Ron Dennis retired as McLaren team
            principal in 2009, handing over to long-time McLaren employee Martin
            Whitmarsh. At the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since
            2004, Whitmarsh was ousted. McLaren announced in 2013 that they
            would be using Honda engines from 2015 onwards, replacing
            Mercedes-Benz.[6] The team raced as McLaren Honda for the first time
            since 1992 at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix. In September 2017,
            McLaren announced they had agreed on an engine supply with Renault
            from 2018 to 2020. McLaren is using Mercedes-Benz engines from the
            2021 season until at least 2024.[7] After initially returning to the
            Indianapolis 500 in 2017 as a backer of Andretti Autosport to run
            Fernando Alonso and then in 2019 as an independent entry, McLaren
            announced in August 2019 that they would run in conjunction with
            Arrow Schmidt Peterson Motorsports starting in 2020 to run the full
            IndyCar Series, the combined entry being named Arrow McLaren SP.[8]
            Initially having no ownership interest in the team, McLaren would
            purchase 75% of the operation in 2021.[9] McLaren entered the
            electric off-road racing series Extreme E in 2022.[10]

            The self-styled “Honey Badger” is fuzzy on the outside and feisty on
            the inside. Drivers beware because behind Ricciardo’s laidback
            persona and big grin is a razor-sharp racer with a bite. The
            Australian combines all-out speed with impressive race craft. Never
            afraid to push to the limits if it means pulling off a pass,
            Ricciardo is a proven race-winner, capable of consistently finishing
            at the business end of the championship table given the right
            machinery. A regular podium-finisher in his days with Red Bull,
            Ricciardo has christened the steps around the world with a dousing
            of Aussie culture – the ‘Shoey’ – as he quaffed champagne from a
            soggy racing boot. Yes it’s goofy, but the trademark celebration
            illustrates why he is loved for his sense of humour but never
            underestimated on track. His career’s next move to Renault’s works
            team in 2019 brought fresh challenges for the Perth pilot, but
            failed to deliver his dream of following Jack Brabham and Alan Jones
            as the next world champion from Down Under and he moved on to
            McLaren for 2021. There he has found a tough young team mate in
            Lando Norris, but has nevertheless returned to winning ways.
            Whatever happens next, Ricciardo is sure to keep on smiling.

            Lando Norris may not be named after Star Wars rebel Lando Calrissian
            - his Mum just liked the moniker - but he has flair and fighting
            spirit in bountiful supply. McLaren had the British teenager on
            their books for two years before fast-tracking him into F1’s galaxy
            of stars in 2019. A firecracker in his junior career, with a
            penchant for pole positions and wheel-to-wheel tussles, Norris
            didn’t let them down. Paired with the highly-rated – and far more
            experienced – Carlos Sainz, his rookie season was impressive, edging
            the Spaniard in their head-to-head qualifying battle, scoring points
            on 11 occasions, and only narrowly missing out on a top-10
            championship placing. It was a similar pattern in 2020, with the
            affable Brit securing a maiden podium and moving up to ninth
            overall. His unstoppable rise continued in 2021, with a further four
            podiums and almost a race win as he dominated another more senior
            team mate, Daniel Ricciardo, to move up to P6 in the final driver
            standings. An exciting talent on track, away from it Norris brims
            with a modest charm and an artistic side sees him design and paint
            his own race gear as a hobby. The focus for the future is allying
            artistry and ambition on track as McLaren rely on the promise of
            youth to take them back to the top. Norris hopes the downforce will
            be with him…
