            Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A. (Italian: [skudeˈriːa ferˈraːri]) is the
            racing division of luxury Italian auto manufacturer Ferrari and the
            racing team that competes in Formula One racing. The team is also
            nicknamed "The Prancing Horse", in reference to their logo. It is
            the oldest surviving and most successful Formula One team, having
            competed in every world championship since the 1950 Formula One
            season.[6] The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race
            cars produced by Alfa Romeo, though by 1947 Ferrari had begun
            building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside
            Formula One are winning the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours
            of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Spa, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of
            Sebring, Bathurst 12 Hour, races for Grand tourer cars and racing on
            road courses of the Targa Florio, the Mille Miglia and the Carrera
            Panamericana. The team is also known for its passionate support
            base, known as the tifosi. The Italian Grand Prix at Monza is
            regarded as the team's home race. As a constructor, Ferrari has a
            record 16 Constructors' Championships, the last of which was won in
            2008. Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, Phil Hill,
            John Surtees, Niki Lauda, Jody Scheckter, Michael Schumacher and
            Kimi Räikkönen have won a record 15 Drivers' Championships for the
            team.[7] Since Räikkönen's title in 2007 the team narrowly lost out
            on the 2008 drivers' title with Felipe Massa and the 2010 and 2012
            drivers' titles with Fernando Alonso. The 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix
            marked Ferrari's 1000th Grand Prix in Formula One. Michael
            Schumacher is the team's most successful driver. Joining the team in
            1996 and departing in 2006, he won five consecutive drivers' titles
            and 72 Grands Prix for the team. His titles came consecutively
            between 2000 and 2004, and the team won consecutive constructors'
            titles between 1999 and 2004; this was the team's most successful
            period. The team's 2022 drivers are Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz
            Jr.

            Born in the Mediterranean idyll of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 on
            a tidal wave of expectation. Practically peerless on his way to the
            GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of skills
            from scorching pole positions, commanding victories – even when his
            car caught fire twice at Silverstone – to an ability to muscle his
            way through the pack. Winning back-to-back championships also taught
            Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond
            of Formula 1 racing. Stepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed
            flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing brilliance on
            Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits – and earning himself
            a money-can’t-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the
            shoes of the Scuderia’s last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen. There
            he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to
            go wheel-to-wheel with established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A
            maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on
            Ferrari’s hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another
            new hero – who then became the first man to out-score Vettel over a
            season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in crushing fashion the
            following year. Out of the car, Leclerc is modest and thoughtful -
            but then he is on his own very personal mission. This exciting young
            talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend and mentor
            Jules Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015. On the evidence so
            far, he is doing them both proud.

            He’s the matador from Madrid racing royalty. After entering F1’s
            Bull Ring paired alongside Max Verstappen at Toro Rosso in 2015,
            Sainz quickly showed his fighting spirit. A tenacious racer, he puts
            the car on the edge as he hustles his way through the pack. No
            wonder Sainz has earned the nickname Chilli. But the Spaniard is
            intelligent as well as instinctive, thinking his way through a race
            and into the points. This calm temperament follows him off track
            where he remains unfazed by the pressures of forging a Grand Prix
            career with a famous name. Sainz is the son of double World Rally
            champion, also his namesake, and has brought some of Dad’s driving
            skills to the F1 circuit – junior loves a delicious dose of drift
            for one. After following in his famous father’s tyre tracks, Sainz
            has had big racing boots to fill – first at McLaren where he
            replaced his childhood hero Fernando Alonso, and now at Ferrari, in
            the seat formerly owned by Sebastian Vettel. It is never easy living
            in the shadow of sporting giants, but Sainz has shown the drive and
            disposition to deal with it. Vamos!
