            Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A. (Italian: [skudeˈriːa ferˈraːri]) is the
            racing division of luxury Italian auto manufacturer Ferrari and the
            racing team that competes in Formula One racing. The team is also
            nicknamed "The Prancing Horse", in reference to their logo. It is
            the oldest surviving and most successful Formula One team, having
            competed in every world championship since the 1950 Formula One
            season.[6] The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race
            cars produced by Alfa Romeo, though by 1947 Ferrari had begun
            building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside
            Formula One are winning the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours
            of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Spa, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of
            Sebring, Bathurst 12 Hour, races for Grand tourer cars and racing on
            road courses of the Targa Florio, the Mille Miglia and the Carrera
            Panamericana. The team is also known for its passionate support
            base, known as the tifosi. The Italian Grand Prix at Monza is
            regarded as the team's home race. As a constructor, Ferrari has a
            record 16 Constructors' Championships, the last of which was won in
            2008. Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, Phil Hill,
            John Surtees, Niki Lauda, Jody Scheckter, Michael Schumacher and
            Kimi Räikkönen have won a record 15 Drivers' Championships for the
            team.[7] Since Räikkönen's title in 2007 the team narrowly lost out
            on the 2008 drivers' title with Felipe Massa and the 2010 and 2012
            drivers' titles with Fernando Alonso. The 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix
            marked Ferrari's 1000th Grand Prix in Formula One. Michael
            Schumacher is the team's most successful driver. Joining the team in
            1996 and departing in 2006, he won five consecutive drivers' titles
            and 72 Grands Prix for the team. His titles came consecutively
            between 2000 and 2004, and the team won consecutive constructors'
            titles between 1999 and 2004; this was the team's most successful
            period. The team's 2022 drivers are Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz
            Jr.

            He’s Max by name, and max by nature. Arriving as Formula 1’s
            youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his
            car, his rivals and the sport’s record books to the limit. The
            baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro Rosso –
            and then the Red Bull – by the horns with his instinctive racing
            style. F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race
            winner – at the age of 18 years and 228 days – with an opportunistic
            but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true
            wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back
            of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the
            plaudits coming. Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard
            defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and
            paymasters. But the mistakes that initially marred his potential
            have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make
            him a blockbuster talent have remained – and the victories have kept
            on coming, culminating in his first F1 drivers’ title following that
            already legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021.
            The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick karting
            Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out
            of Dad’s house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his
            family, and though he’s not afraid to speak his mind, he can still
            be surprisingly shy. Having become the Netherlands' first world
            champion aged just 24, the expectations for the next generation’s
            leading light are sky high – but with Verstappen there’s a feeling
            that the sky’s the limit.

            He’s the fighter with a gentle touch from the land of the Lucha
            Libre. Perez’s reputation in F1 has been built on opposite
            approaches to Grand Prix racing. On the one hand, he is a punchy
            combatant who wrestles his way through the pack and into the points.
            Never afraid to add a bit of spice to his on-track encounters, even
            his team mates don’t always escape the Mexican’s heat. Then on the
            other hand, Perez is a smooth operator, a master at managing tyres
            to eke out extra performance and give him the upper hand on
            strategy. A firm favourite on the grid after his time with Sauber,
            McLaren, Force India and Racing Point, Perez has matured into an
            analytical racer and team player. A proud countryman, the
            Guadalajara gunslinger has amassed more points than any other
            Mexican in the history of F1. In Sakhir 2020 he also matched hero
            and compatriot Pedro Rodriguez by taking the chequered flag in first
            – a performance that landed him a seat with title contenders Red
            Bull. There he provided strong support to Max Verstappen’s 2021
            championship-winning campaign, also adding another victory to his
            own tally. More wins may not be assured, especially with Verstappen
            as team mate, but Perez working hard and racing with his heart are.
