            In September 2019, Toro Rosso announced their intention to change
            their naming rights for the 2020 championship.[7] It was announced
            on 1 December 2019 that the team had selected "AlphaTauri" as their
            new moniker to promote parent company Red Bull's fashion label of
            the same name by purchasing Toro Rosso's naming rights. Thus, they
            became Scuderia AlphaTauri and retired the Scuderia Toro Rosso
            moniker after fourteen years.[8] The team's involvement in Formula
            One can be traced back to the 1985 season when they first competed
            as Minardi. The team has been owned by Red Bull GmbH since the 2006
            season. Scuderia AlphaTauri, or simply AlphaTauri, is an Italian
            Formula One racing team and constructor. It is one of two Formula
            One constructors owned by Austrian beverage company Red Bull, the
            other being Red Bull Racing. The constructor was rebranded for the
            2020 Formula One World Championship from "Toro Rosso" to
            "AlphaTauri" in order to promote the AlphaTauri fashion brand.[5]
            According to Franz Tost and Helmut Marko, Scuderia AlphaTauri is no
            longer the junior team but the sister team to Red Bull Racing.[6]

            If there’s one man who knows how big a rollercoaster ride an F1
            driver’s career can be, it’s Pierre Gasly! The flying Frenchman was
            called up to make his 2017 debut in Malaysia in place of Daniil
            Kvyat and, after proving his mettle, he was named a Toro Rosso
            driver the following year. A further 21 races into his fledgling
            career, Gasly was moved up again – this time to replace Red Bull big
            gun Daniel Ricciardo. Gasly seemed to have a knack of being in the
            right place at the right time – a quality that’s equally handy on
            track. A series of impressive 2018 performances for Toro Rosso –
            including a brilliant fourth place in Bahrain – showed exciting
            promise for what he might do with the ‘A’ team in 2019.
            Unfortunately that promise only appeared in flashes – and he quickly
            suffered from unfavourable comparisons with superstar team mate Max
            Verstappen. So much so that after the summer break, he was sent back
            to Toro Rosso, with another young up-and-comer – Alex Albon – being
            given a shot in the ‘senior’ Red Bull seat. But Gasly bounced back,
            as only Gasly can. In the season’s remaining nine races he scored
            almost as many points as team mate Kvyat managed over the entire
            year – and secured his best-ever race result with P2 in Brazil. That
            trajectory continued in 2020, peaking with an emotional maiden win
            at the renamed AlphaTauri team’s home race in Italy, and didn’t let
            up in 2021 when he was back on the podium and scored 110 of the
            squad’s 142 points. The question now is can he maintain momentum and
            earn himself another shot at the F1 bigtime…

            In the entire history of Formula 1, no Japanese driver has ever won
            a World Championship Grand Prix. Could Yuki Tsunoda be the first?
            Red Bull certainly think so, with the youngster very much on the
            path to their senior team if he continues to impress as he has done
            over the past few years. Tsunoda's ascent to the top tier of
            motorsport was astonishingly rapid: he went from racing in Japanese
            F4 to a Formula 1 seat with AlphaTauri in just over three years,
            having arrived in Europe in 2019 with no knowledge of the circuits.
            But after a slow start in F3, followed by a hugely impressive debut
            F2 campaign that saw him finish third in the championship and pick
            up three wins along the way, Tsunoda proved he had the speed and the
            race craft to force his way on to the F1 grid. He may not have
            adapted to Grand Prix racing quite as quickly as he did to F2, but
            given time he could yet find himself battling at the very sharp end
            in a Red Bull.
